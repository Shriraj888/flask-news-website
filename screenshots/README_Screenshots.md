2. Use PNG format for crisp text and UI elements
3. Use descriptive filenames as specified above
4. Ensure images are clear and readable

## üìã Checklist

Once you have all screenshots:
- [ ] homepage.png (1200x800px)
- [ ] news-feed.png (1200x800px) 
- [ ] search-filter.png (1200x600px)
- [ ] mobile-view.png (375x812px)
- [ ] contact-form.png (1200x800px)

All images should showcase the modern dark theme and responsive design features.

## üîó Alternative Solutions

If you cannot take screenshots immediately:
1. The README already contains placeholder paths
2. You can add screenshots later by simply adding the image files
3. The README will automatically display them once added
4. Consider using placeholder images or demo screenshots temporarily
